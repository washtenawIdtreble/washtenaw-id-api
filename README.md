# The Washtenaw ID API

## About

This API supports a [web application](https://github.com/washtenawIdtreble/washtenaw-id-webapp) that acts as a guide for
holders of the [Washtenaw County ID](https://www.washtenaw.org/269/County-Identification-Card-Program) to find
businesses and services where they can use the ID to prove their identity without fear of being questioned.

The Washtenaw ID is a county-wide photo identification card created with the purpose of addressing a pressing human
rights issue in our community â€“ the lack of secure and reliable identification of approximately 26,000 residents of
Washtenaw County. Equating to approximately 7% of the general public, these U.S. Citizens, which disproportionately
represent stigmatized populations, run into a variety of consistent and significant daily barriers.

Not having an ID makes the simple daily things that we all do, impossible: You cannot prove your identity to law
enforcement, cash a check, sign a lease or even check out a book from the library.

Lack of identification is not just a problem affecting the undocumented community. Older adults, individuals with mental
illness, those who are homeless, transgender folks and those of low socioeconomic status, all have been marginalized by
state and federal identification systems that result in an accurate photo ID being inaccessible to them.
